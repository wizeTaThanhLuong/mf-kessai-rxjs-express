# Project Generation

## Nodejs and Express
> Project's structure was generated by [express-generator-typescript](https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/express-generator-typescript) package

## MF Kessai API
> Client API, for MF Kessai, was generated by openAPI generator with TypeScript/RxJS framework
> Generated code includes: src/apis folder, src/models folder, and src/runtime.ts file

The original source are in [master_origin](https://github.com/wizeTaThanhLuong/mf-kessai-rxjs-express/tree/master_origin) branch.

## Config environment and write testing router
Edit:
- env/
- package.json
- tsconfig.json (I try add libs `dom`, `dom.iterable`, `esnext` into fix built-in issue with DOM, but not work)
- tsconfig.prod.json
- src/routes/index.ts (add apiKey to configuration)
- src/runtime.ts

Adding:
- src/routes/Billings.ts

## Fix Errors
 - The `runtime.ts` file has some type definition errors, so it need to leave some `// @ts-ignore` comments
 - The source uses some built-in modules of DOM (FormData, XMLHTTPRequest) which's only supported by web browser.
 Therefore, it's need to be installed with [@types/form-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/form-data)
  and [xmlhttprequest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlhttprequest) package. But, the `xmlhttprequest` does not have
  supported typescript version, and we must use `require` instead `import` for using this module.

## Testing API
It's need to config MF_KESSAI_API_KEY in `env` files, before testing.
