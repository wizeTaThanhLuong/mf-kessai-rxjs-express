# Project Generation

## Nodejs and Express
> Project's structure was generated by [express-generator-typescript](https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/express-generator-typescript) package

## MF Kessai API
> Client API, for MF Kessai, was generated by openAPI generator with TypeScript/RxJS framework
> Generated code includes: src/apis folder, src/models folder, and src/runtime.ts file

The original source are in [master_origin](https://github.com/wizeTaThanhLuong/mf-kessai-rxjs-express/tree/master_origin) branch.

## Fix Errors
 - The `runtime.ts` file has some type definition errors, so it need to leave some `// @ts-ignore` comments.

  - [See more...](https://github.com/wizeTaThanhLuong/mf-kessai-rxjs-express/commit/6226eb82cc0bc1249146946c2628e88dcf59d2d2)

## Sendgrid Mailer
> We use sendgrid API via [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer),
 and [nodemailer-sendgrid-transport](https://github.com/sendgrid/nodemailer-sendgrid-transport) package.
  
## Testing API
It's need to config `MF_KESSAI_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `env` files, before testing.
